# simple_shell

This is repository contains The Simple Shell project that aims to build a command line interpreter. The project helps us to understand how  the command line works and gives us hands on experience with processes, file descriptors, signals and overall functioning of the operating system. It is a collaborative work between Oluwafemi Awoyera and Chinecherem Onovo.
